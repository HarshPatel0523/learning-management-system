## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HarshPatel0523/learning-management-system.git
    cd learning-management-system
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend:**
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      ```bash
      cd lms-backend
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `lms-backend` root and add the following environment variables:
      ```env
      PORT=5001
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
      JWT_EXPIRY=7d

      # Cloudinary Credentials
      CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
      CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
      CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
      ```
    - Start the backend server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

3.  **Setup Frontend:**
    - Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
      ```bash
      cd lms-frontend
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to `http://localhost:5001`. No extra configuration is needed if the backend is running on that port.
    - Start the frontend development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

The application should now be running, with the frontend available at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:5001`.
